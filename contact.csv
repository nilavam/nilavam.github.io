Also need to show that v_2 is not the additive inverse of itself), 3:-4.5 (Part 1: Need to explicitly show what kernel is, try to think what happens when p'=0. Part 2: Need to explicitly show what the image is, try to think about P_{n-1}. Part 3: Need to show counter-example. Part 4: Need to prove linearity)"
