(1) Write an abstract java class named 'Student' with the following private fields:
  - name (String),
  - age (int),
  - gender (String) (possible values are from the set {"male", "female"})
  - program (String) (possible values are from the set {"BSc", "MSc", "PhD"})
Also include public concrete mutator and accessor methods to obtain and modify these fields.
Also include a public abstract method getRoommateCount to return an integer indicating the number of roommates
the student has in the hostel.

(2) Write an abstract class 'CourseStudent', extending 'Student', which has 
the following additional private fields
  - cgpa (int)
  - backlogs (int)
along with the corresponding public concrete mutator and accessor methods.

(3) Write java classes 'BScStudent' and 'MScStudent', each one extending 
'CourseStudent' and implementing the abstract method getRoommateCount.
All objects of the class 'BScStudent' should return 2 and
all objects of the class 'MScStudent' should return 1.
Use appropriate qualifier to ensure that all objects of the class 'BScStudent' use a single
memory location to store the number of roommates fixed for BSc students. Similarly for MSc students.

(4) Write a java class 'PhDStudent' that extends 'Student' and has the following additional private field
  - advisor (String).
along with the corresponding public concrete mutator and accessor methods. Make sure your class
also implements the methods getRoommateCount from the Student class. All objects of this class should
return 0 as number of roommates.

(5) Write a java class 'StudentUtils' with methods as described below.
  - maleThreePerRoom(Student[] students): should print the names of male students who have two roommates.
  - cgpaAtLeast(CourseStudent[] students, int minCgpa): should print the names of students with cgpa at least minCgpa.

Ensure that your classes compile with the provided class
Assignment1.java.

Upload to moodle a file named 'Yourname.tar.gz' containing six files 
Student.java, CourseStudent.java, PhDStudent.java, BScStudent.java, 
MScStudent.java and StudentUtils.java. The tar.gz archive should not 
have any directories/subdirectories in it. The java classes should not 
contain any package declarations, nor should there be any file other 
than the six mentioned.
