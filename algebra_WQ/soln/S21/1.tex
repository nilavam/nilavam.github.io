$$\text{Fields} \subsetneq \text{Principal Ideal Domains}\subsetneq \text{Unique Factorization Domains}\subsetneq \text{Integral Domains}$$

Integral domain but not UFD: $\Z\left[\sqrt{-5}\right]$. This clearly has no zero divisors. But $6$ can be factored as $2\cdot 3$ and $\left(1+\sqrt{-5}\right)\left(1-\sqrt{-5}\right)$ and $2,3,1\pm\sqrt{-5}$ are all primes. 

UFD but not PID: $\Z[x]$. This is known to be a UFD, but the ideal $(2,x)$ is not generated by one element.

PID but not field: $\Z$. This is known to be a PID, but $2$ doesn't have an inverse.
