\begin{sol}
Let $P,Q$ be the set of elements that generate $G$ and orders of elements in $P,Q$ are $p,q$ repsectively. Let $A$ be an abelian group, and $\phi:G\to A$ a group map. Since $p,q$ are distinct primes, there are integers $u,v\in \Z$ such that $up+vq = 1$. Let $a\in P,b\in Q$. Then $1 = f(1)^{-u} = f(a^p)^{-u} = f(a^{-up}) = f(a)^{qv-1}$.
