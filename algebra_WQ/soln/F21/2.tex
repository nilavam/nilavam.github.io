\begin{sol}
Let $P\subseteq \Z[x]$ be a prime ideal which is not principal. $\Z[x]$ is Noetherian, so $P$ is finitely generated. Let $\set{f_1,\cdots,f_n}$ be such a minimal set of generators (minimal in the sense of number of elements). Since $P$ is not principal, $n\geq 2$. Call $f=f_1,g=f_2 \in P$. Let their gcd be $d\in\Z[x]$.
