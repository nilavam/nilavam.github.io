The given statement is equivalent to showing the existence of an invertible $B$ such that $A^t=B^{-1}AB$. This is just saying that $A,A^t$ are similar. Since we are working over $\C$, we can simply work with JCF. This suffices because if $A=X^{-1}JX$ where $J$ is the JCF of $A$, then $A^{t}=B^{-1}AB$ is equivalent to saying that $YJ^tY^{-1} = B^{-1}X^{-1}JXB$ where $Y = X^t$, which is equivalent to saying that $J^t = (XBY)^{-1}X (XBY)$. This is simply saying that $J$ is similar to its transpose. Since $J$ is made of block matrices, transpose treats every square block independently, and using the fact that $\begin{bmatrix}P&\\&Q\end{bmatrix}\sim \begin{bmatrix}U&\\&V\end{bmatrix}$ if $P\sim U$ and $Q\sim V$, it is enough to show that every Jordan block is similar to its transpose. (Here $\sim$ stands for similarity of matrices.)

To see this, we start with a Jordan block $J$ of size $n\times n$ and eigenvalue $\lambda$. Let $T:\C^n\to\C^n$ be a linear transformation whose matrix with respect to the basis $\pmb e=(e_1,\cdots,e_n)$ is $J$. The action of $T$ is given by $Te_1 = \lambda e_1$ and $Te_j = \lambda e_j+e_{j-1}$ for $1<j\leq n$. Now we look at the matrix of $T$ in the basis $\pmb f = (f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ where $f_i = e_{n-i+1}\forall 1\leq i\leq n$. Clearly the first column of $T$ in this basis is determined by $Jf_1 = \lambda e_n + e_{n-1} = \lambda f_1 + f_2$ which corresponds to the column matrix wehere first two entries are $\lambda, 1$ respectively and everything else is $0$. The $j^{\text{th}}$ column $(1\leq j<n)$ is given by $Tf_j = Te_{n+1-j} = \lambda e_{n+1-j} + e_{n-j} = \lambda f_j + f+{j+1}$ which corresponds to the columns where the $j^{\text{th}}, (j+1)^{\text{st}}$ entries are $\lambda, 1$ respectively, and everything else is $0$. This means that $[T]_{\pmb e} = [T]_{\pmb f}^t$. Since both the matrices $[T]_{\pmb e}, [T]_{\pmb f}$ correspond to the same linear operator, but represented in different bases, they are similar. This proves that every Jordan block is similar to its transpose.
